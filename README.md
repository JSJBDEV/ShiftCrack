# ShiftCrack
a superfast but fairly basic shift cipher brute forcer

Basically, this  program looks for 1 letter words, generally in the english language there are only 2, that is, "A" or "I"; once the program has found a one letter word, it works out the distance from "a" or "i" and applies the same shift to every other character.

# Benifits
• really quick and small file
• can break any thing that uses any amounts of shifts, (probably)

# Drawbacks
• can only understand alphabetical letters and spaces
• would need improving for more complex ciphers
